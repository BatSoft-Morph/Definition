Usage rights and rules of the Morph Protocol Definition:

1. The Morph Protocol Definition is free for anyone to implement and use.
This is permanent and for all time.  However...

2. The Morph Protocol Definition MUST NOT be altered nor extended in any way by anyone other than by Peter Sven Thönell.
This will last until Peter Thönell has found/established a group that is trusted to maintain the definition of the Morph Protocol sustainably and responsibly.

3. ALL deployed Morph Protocol implementations MUST be correct and accurate implementations of the Morph Protocol Definition, regardless of context, such as platform, scope or other variables.
Only Morph Protocol implementations that are used for studying and experimenting with the Morph Protocol are exempt.

In essence, you have full READ and EXECUTE rights, but NOT WRITE rights, to the Morph Protocol Definition.


The reasons for these restrictions are to enable the Morph Protocol to be ubiquitously available, remain useful, be freely available and cost-free, while preventing fragmentation, incompatibilities and proprietary implementations that would reduce the usability and longevity of the Morph protocol.

Any questions or suggestions for changes to the Morph Protocol can be sent to: peter@batsoft.com.au
Good suggestions are likely to be adopted, though possibly with alterations.


Enjoy!  =)
